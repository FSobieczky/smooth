smooth.c:

Compile with: 
  
   gcc smooth.c -lm -o smooth


Usage: smooth <file> n s [<outfile>]

`file' is plain PGM (Magic number P2)

Writes smoothed file in PGM ASCII format to `file.out' or `outfile', if specified.  

 n is an integer greater or equal to 1 = number of iterates 
     in the smooothing (e.g. 3)

 s is the difference in greyvalue between two neighboring greyvalues 
   (range: 0 - 255) to be sufficiently different so that the edge connecting 
   the two vertices is removed from the lattice and no smoothing across it 
   takes place..
